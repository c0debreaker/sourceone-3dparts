# 3D parts made specifically for a TBS SourceOne frame

TODO(s):
- Camera mount needs adjustments. The upper support of the 3d-printed part can be seen on the video but just a little.
- The Vifly Finder holder is great but one side must have 2 tubes to make it more stable.
- Make the Caddx Vista antenna holder a little thinner, maybe?
- Redesign the caddx vista air unit holder by adjusting the height of the gap between bottom face of holder and lower frame of the TBS sourceone frame.It's only 2mm. 3mm would be nice.
- Create a camera lens protector.

Note(s)
- Some of the files here are old. It was for my previous setup.
